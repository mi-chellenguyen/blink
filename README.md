## Inspiration
Having to deal with overstuffed wallets filled by business cards from networking event and lost connections due to misplaced contact information is extremely fraustrating. As we are living in the digital age, we began to shift into a paperless society. Blink allows us network easily by seemlessly share and save contact informations using NFC techology, so you won't have to hold on to those easy-to-lose business cards again.

## What It Does
Blink lets users sign up and create a profile to share with other users via NFC. They can also receive "cards" from our users and it will be automatically on the cloud.

## How We Built It
Blink was built using Android Studio and Java with Google's Firebase integration. The app utilize NFC technology that is navitely built into most Android devices.

## Challenges We Ran Into
As with most coding projects, we faced various adversities attributed to coding projects. From having to read large amounts of documentation on how to implement various different functions of Google Firebase and NFC technology to the hard learning curve presented in Android Studio, they factors became challenges for our group to overcome.

## What We learned
We learned how to develop an Android app using Android Studio from scratch and the Google Firebase database and authentication platform.
